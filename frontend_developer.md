# Front-end developer

### The aim:
- Get a general overview of React.js;
- Understand how React hooks work.

### Main task:
- Create a product list page of any product category (eg. children toys, pet food).
- The product list should be fetched from the external source
- The page should have a search input that filters products without page refresh
- Search should be performed once the user stops writing
- The page should be adaptive - looking good both on desktop and mobile

### Requirements:
- Use at least one Class component
- Use at least one Functional component
- Use each of the following React hooks at least once: useEffect, useState

### Bonus points:
- For styling preferably use the "styled-components" library
- Build the project using Typescript

### Notes:
- Some requirement points can be skipped if you feel like they are too complex at the time. Please provide a comment in the code about what has been skipped. We do expect all or most of the requirements implemented if applying for a more senior position.

### ** Important **
- It is ok to re-use parts of code from other sources. But it is important to understand it and to be able to explain what it does, as well as to attribute the original author.
