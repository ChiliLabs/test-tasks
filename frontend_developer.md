### Notes:
- Some requirement points can be skipped if you feel like they are too complex at the time. Focus first on business requirements, designs afterwards. Please provide a comment in the code about what has been skipped.

### ** Important **
- It is ok to re-use parts of code from other sources. But it is important to understand it and to be able to explain what it does, as well as to attribute the original author.
