# Back-end developer

## Main task:
- Create a RESTful service with the following functionality:
- Registration with identifier and password. Nickname, email or phone can be used as a user identifier, confirmation is not required. Auth token(s) must be returned on success
- Login with identifier and password. Auth token(s) must be returned on success.
- Avatar upload (requires auth). Uploaded image URL must be returned on success.
- Socket connection endpoint (requires auth). After connecting to it client must receive messages when the avatar is changed.
- User deletion (requires auth). Success must be returned if a user is fully deleted (registration and avatar). All socket connections must stop, the user must not be able to log in with any previously issued auth tokens.
- Use stateless authentication (JWT)
- Use JSend (GitHub - omniti-labs/jsend: JSend is a specification for a simple, no-frills, JSON based format for application-level communication. ) for response format. Generate an easy-to-use and understand documentation for API (use services like "apiary").

### Tech stack:
- Feel free to pick any tech you are most comfortable with. The same applies to persistence - any Relational or NoSQL DB will do.

### Time limit:
- There is no time limitation for the task, we favor quality over speed :)

### Bonus points:
- Dockerfile / Docker compose file & ability to run the service in 1 command on a machine with nothing but docker and docker-compose installed
- oAuth2.0 (https://oauth.net/2/) compliant authentication (access / refresh token pair)
- Unit tests (we don't expect 100% coverage but rather see how do you approach testing)
- Integration tests against an in-memory database

### Notes:
- Some requirement points can be skipped if you feel like they are too complex at the time. Please provide a comment in the code about what has been skipped. We do expect all or most of the requirements implemented if applying for a more senior position.

### ** Important **
- It is ok to re-use parts of code from other sources. But it is important to understand it and to be able to explain what it does, as well as to attribute the original author.
