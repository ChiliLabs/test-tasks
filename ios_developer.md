## The Task:
- Create a gif search application using the Giphy service;

### Primary Requirements:
## Technical
- Use Swift;
- Auto search - search requests performed after a minor delay after the user stops typing;
- Loading more results when scrolling;
- Comments on code that could need an additional explanation;
- Networking layer without using any external 3rd party libraries (like Alamofire);
- Vertical & horizontal orientation support;
- Error handling;
- Unit tests - as much as you see fit;
  
## UI
- At least 2 views sourced by data from Giphy;
- Results are displayed in a grid;
- Clicking on a grid item should navigate to a detailed Gif view.
- Loading indicators;
- Error display;

### Bonus points:
- Using reactive programming approach (RxSwift / Combine);
- Using of an architecture pattern;
- Network availablity handling;
- View navigation is handled separately from controller code (a navigation pattern);

### Notes:
- 3rd party frameworks are only allowed to help display individual gifs & in RxSwift use case;
- No time limit. Quality > Speed;
- Documentation (https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/)
- UI up to interpretation - only things mentioned in requirements are mandatory;
- If any of the primary requirements cannot be completed, it must be commented what solutions were attempted and what problems were encountered.
