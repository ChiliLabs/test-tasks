# Flutter developer

## The Task:
- Create a gif search application using the Giphy service;

### Primary Requirements:
## Technical
- Primary platforms - iOS & Android;
- Auto search - requests to retrieve Gif information from the service are made automatically with a small delay after user stops typing;
- Pagination - loading more results when scrolling;
- Vertical & horizontal orientation support;
- Error handling;
- Unit tests - as much as you see fit;
  
## UI
- Responsive & matching platform guidelines;
- At least 2 views sourced by data from Giphy;
- Results are displayed in a grid;
- Clicking on a grid item should navigate to a detailed Gif view.
- Loading indicators;
- Error display;

### Bonus points:
- Using state management approaches or libraries such as BLoC (flutter_bloc), Riverpod or others;
- Using an understandable architecture pattern;
- Page navigation is separate from page widget code (a Coordinator pattern or similar);
- Network availability handling;
