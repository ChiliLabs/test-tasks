# iOS developer

## Main task:
- Create a gif search application using the Giphy service;

### Requirements:
- Use Swift;
- RxSwift / Combine;
- At least 2 views sourced by data from Giphy;
- Auto search - search requests performed after a minor delay after the user stops typing;
- Search results are displayed in a UICollectionView;
- Loading more results when scrolling;
- Loading indicators;
- Unit tests for more important logic (100% coverage not required, just for parts that you would feel like are most important);
- Comments on code that could need an additional explanation;

### Notes:
- 3rd party frameworks allowed;
- No time limit. Quality > Speed;
- Documentation (https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#search-endpoint)
- UI up to interpretation - only things mentioned in requirements are mandatory;
- Some requirement points can be skipped if you feel like they are too complex at the time. Please provide a comment in the code about what has been skipped. We do expect all or most of the requirements implemented if applying for a more senior position.

### ** Important **
- It is ok to re-use parts of code from other sources. But it is important to understand it and to be able to explain what it does, as well as to attribute the original author.
